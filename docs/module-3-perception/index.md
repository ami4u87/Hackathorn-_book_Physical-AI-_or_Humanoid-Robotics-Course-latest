# Module 3: Perception & Control

This module focuses on perception systems for robotics, including vision and depth perception, object detection, and pose estimation. You will learn to implement perception pipelines and integrate them with robot control systems.

## Learning Objectives

- Implement vision and depth perception
- Perform object detection and pose estimation
- Publish poses to TF tree
- Visualize perception results in RViz2
- Integrate perception with control systems
