# Module 5: Capstone Project

This capstone module integrates all previous modules into a comprehensive demonstration where a simulated humanoid responds to voice commands, perceives the environment, plans motion, and executes manipulation tasks autonomously.

## Learning Objectives

- Integrate all modules into a complete system
- Process voice commands through speech-to-text
- Execute full pipeline: perception → planning → control
- Complete autonomous manipulation task
- Document and present the final system
