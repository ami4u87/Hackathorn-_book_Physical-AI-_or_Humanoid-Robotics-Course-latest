# Module 2: Simulation Environments

This module covers simulation environments for humanoid robotics, including Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac. You will learn to set up simulation environments, configure robot models, and validate physics-based interactions.

## Learning Objectives

- Set up Gazebo Harmonic with ROS 2 bridge
- Configure Unity with ROS-TCP-Connector
- Work with NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- Validate physics-based interactions
- Test robot models in simulation
